# Notebooks

This repository presents all numerical calculations used in the paper
"Chern Bands with Higher-Order Van Hove Singularities on Topological Moiré Surface States"
in Jupyter notebook format.

Each notebook is self-contained and documents a specific calculation:
- Hamiltonian construction
- Band structure
- Density of states
- Higher-order Van Hove singularity analysis
- Anomalous Hall conductivity

The notebooks are intended for transparency and inspection rather than
as a reusable software package.
