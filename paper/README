**Title:**  
Chern Bands with Higher-Order Van Hove Singularities on Topological Moiré Surface States

**Description:**  
The Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory reproduce the numerical
calculations and figures presented in this paper, including the construction
of moiré Hamiltonians, band structure, density of states, higher-order
Van Hove singularity analysis, and anomalous Hall conductivity.
